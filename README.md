# mc-simulation-mpi-cuda
 A parallelized Monte Carlo simulation using OpenMPI for distributed computing and CUDA for GPU acceleration, modeling systems like the Ising model for statistical physics. This repository demonstrates efficient high-performance computing (HPC) techniques to simulate physical systems and perform large-scale computations.
